Unit test
=========

In a software package as dynamic and collaborative as OpenFAST, confidence in multiple
layers of code can only be accomplished with a strong system of unit tests.
Through robust testing practices, the entire OpenFAST community will be able to
understand the intention behind code blocks and help debug or expand functionality
quicker and with more confidence.

Unit testing in OpenFAST modules is accomplished through
 `pFUnit <http://pfunit.sourceforge.net>`__. This framework provides a Fortran
abstraction to the popular `xUnit <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUnit>`__ structure.
This package is compiled along with OpenFAST through CMake when 
the CMake variable ``BUILD_TESTING`` is turned on.
