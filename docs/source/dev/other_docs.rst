Other documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Additional documentation exists that may be useful for developers seeking deeper
understanding of the solver and mathematics.  This documentation is not generally
necessary for most development efforts.

- :download:`DCM_Interpolation.pdf    <../../OtherSupporting/DCM_Interpolation/DCM_Interpolation.pdf>`
   This is a summary of the mathematics used in the interpolation of 
   DCM (direction cosine matrices) using logarithmic mapping and matrix exponentials.
- :download:`OpenFAST_Algorithms.pdf  <../../OtherSupporting/OpenFAST_Algorithms/OpenFAST_Algorithms.pdf>`
  This is a summary of the solve method used in the glue code.
