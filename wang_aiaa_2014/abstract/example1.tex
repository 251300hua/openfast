\subsection{Example 1: Static bending of a cantilever beam}

The first example is a benchmark problem for geometrically nonlinear
analysis of beams \cite{Simo1985,Xiao-Zhong:2012}. We calculate the static
deflection of a cantilever beam that is subjected at its free end to
a constant moment $M$.  The length of the beam $L$ is $10$ in and the cross-sectional stiffness 
matrix is given below:
\begin{equation}
    \label{StifE1}
    C^* = 10^3 \times \begin{bmatrix}
	1770 & 0    & 0    & 0    & 0    & 0   \\
	 0    & 1770 & 0    & 0    & 0    & 0   \\
	 0   &   0   & 1770 & 0    & 0    & 0   \\
	 0   &   0   &  0    & 8.16 & 0    & 0   \\
	 0   &   0   &  0    &  0    & 86.9 & 0   \\
	 0   &   0   &  0    &  0    &   0   & 215
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
\mas{add units to above eq}
\textcolor{red}{The units associated with the stiffness values throughout this section are $C_{ij}^*$ (lb), $C_{i,j+3}^*$ (lb.in), and $C_{i+3,j+3}^*$ (lb.in$^2$) for $i,j = 1,2,3$.} It is pointed out that the term with a asterisk denotes it is resolved in the material coordinate system. A sketch of this case can be found in Figure~\ref{E1Sketch}.

The load applied at the tip is given by the following equation:
\begin{equation}
    \label{E1Load}
    M_2 = \lambda \bar{M}_2
\end{equation}
where $\bar{M}_2 = \pi \frac{EI_2}{L}$. The parameter $\lambda$ will vary between $0$ and $2$. In 
this case, the beam is discretized with two $5^{th}$ order elements. The deformations of the beam obtained from BeamDyn are shown in Figure~\ref{E1Deform}.

bending moments. \mas{is this analytical or LSFE-calculated?}\textcolor{red}{it's obtained from BeamDyn, as noted in the discussion on this figure.}}
    \label{E1Deform}
\end{figure}
The calculated results are compared with the analytical solution, which can be found in Ref.\cite{Mayo-etal:2004} as
\begin{equation}
    \label{E1Analytical}
    u_1 = \rho \sin \left( \frac{x_1}{\rho} \right) - x_1~~~~~u_3 = \rho
\left(1-\cos\left(\frac{x_1}{\rho}\right) \right)
\end{equation}
The results can be found in Table~\ref{E1u1} and \ref{E1u3}, respectively. Good agreement can be observed between these two sets of results.

 The rotation parameters at each node along beam axis $x_1$ obtained from BeamDyn are plotted in Figure~\ref{E1Rot} for $\lambda = 0.8$ and $\lambda = 2.0$, respectively. It is noted that the three-dimensional rotations are represented by Wiener-Milenkovi\'c parameter defined in the following equation:
 \begin{equation}
     \vec{p} = 4 \tan\left(\frac{\phi}{4} \right) \bar{n} 
     \label{WMParameter}
 \end{equation}
 where $\phi$ is the rotation angle and $\bar{n}$ is the unit vector of rotation axis. The singularity existing in the above definition can be removed by a rescaling operation, which can be observed in Figure~\ref{E1Rot}.

\textcolor{red}{Finally, we conduct a convergence study on the LSFE. The convergence rate is compared with conventional quadratic elements used in Dymore, which is a finite element based multibody dynamics code for the comprehensive modeling of flexible multibody systems. It is pointed out that user can choose element up to $3^rd$ order in Dymore.} Figure~\ref{E1Conv} shows the normalized error $\epsilon(u)$, where $u$ is
the tip displacement (at $x=L$), as a function of the number of model nodes
for the calculation with Dymore quadratic elements (QE) and a single
Legendre spectral element finite (LSFE), where
\begin{equation}
    \label{E1Error}
    \epsilon(u) = \left| \frac{u-u^a}{u^a} \right|
\end{equation}
and $u$ is the test solution and $u^a$ is the analytical solution.  The parameter $\lambda$ is set to $1.0$ for this case. The Legendre spectral elements (with $p$-refinement) exhibit highly desirable exponential convergence to machine precision error.

by increasing polynomial order and QE model refinement was accomplished by
increasing the number of elements.  }
