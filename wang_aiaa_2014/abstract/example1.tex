\subsection{Example 1: Static bending of a cantilever beam}

The first example is a common benchmark problem for geometrically nonlinear
analysis of beams\cite{Simo1985,Xiao-Zhong:2012}. We calculate the static
deflection of a cantilever beam that is subjected at its free end to
a constant moment about the $x_2$ axis, $M_2$; a system schematic is shown in Figure~\ref{E1Sketch}.  The length of the beam $L$ is $10$ inches and the cross-sectional stiffness 
matrix is 
\begin{equation}
    \label{StifE1}
    C^* = 10^3 \times \begin{bmatrix}
	1770 & 0    & 0    & 0    & 0    & 0   \\
	 0    & 1770 & 0    & 0    & 0    & 0   \\
	 0   &   0   & 1770 & 0    & 0    & 0   \\
	 0   &   0   &  0    & 8.16 & 0    & 0   \\
	 0   &   0   &  0    &  0    & 86.9 & 0   \\
	 0   &   0   &  0    &  0    &   0   & 215
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
which has units of $C_{ij}^*$ (lb), $C_{i,j+3}^*$ (lb.in), and
$C_{i+3,j+3}^*$ (lb.in$^2$) for $i,j = 1,2,3$; these units apply to all
subsequent stiffness matrices. It is pointed out that the term with an
asterisk denotes that it is resolved in the reference configuration.

\end{figure} 

The load applied at the tip is given by 
\begin{equation}
    \label{E1Load}
    M_2 = \lambda \bar{M}_2
\end{equation}
where $\bar{M}_2 = \pi \frac{EI_2}{L}$; and the parameter $\lambda$ will vary between $0$ and $2$. In 
this case, the beam is discretized with two $5^{th}$-order Legendre
spectral FEs. The
static deformations of the beam obtained from BeamDyn are shown in
Figure~\ref{E1Deform} for six different tip moments.
The calculated tip displacements are compared with the analytical solution
in Tables~\ref{E1u1} and \ref{E1u3},
which can be found in Mayo et al.\cite{Mayo-etal:2004} as
\begin{equation}
    \label{E1Analytical}
    u_1 = \rho \sin \left( \frac{x_1}{\rho} \right) - x_1~~~~~u_3 = \rho
\left(1-\cos\left(\frac{x_1}{\rho}\right) \right)
\end{equation}
At this discretization level, BeamDyn results are virtually
identical to those of the analytical solution.

The rotation parameter $p_2$ at each node along beam axis $x_1$ obtained
from BeamDyn are plotted in Figure~\ref{E1Rot:Rot} for $\lambda = 0.8$ and
$\lambda = 2.0$, respectively. A rescaling can be observed from this figure
for the case $\lambda = 2.0$. It is noted that although the rotation
parameters are not continuous between elements due to the rescaling
operation, the relative rotations are continuous in a single element as
described in the previous section, which can be observed in
Figure~\ref{E1Rot:Rel}.

Finally, we conduct a convergence study of the BeamDyn LSFEs. The
convergence rate is compared with conventional quadratic elements used in
Dymore \cite{Dymore:2013}, which is a finite-element
based multibody dynamics code for the comprehensive modeling of flexible
multibody systems. 
%It is pointed out that user can choose element up to
%$3^rd$ order in Dymore. 
Figure~\ref{E1Conv} shows the normalized error
$\varepsilon(u)$, where $u$ is the calculated tip displacement (at $x=L$), as a function
of the number of model nodes for the calculation with Dymore quadratic finite
elements (QFE) and a single LSFE, where
\begin{equation}
    \label{E1Error}
    \varepsilon(u) = \left| \frac{u-u^a}{u^a} \right|
\end{equation}
and where $u^a$ is the analytical solution.  The parameter $\lambda$ is set
to $1.0$ for this case. The LSFEs (with $p$-refinement) exhibit highly
desirable exponential convergence to machine-precision error, whereas the
conventional quadratic elements are limited to algebraic convergence.  Here,
for a given model size, an LSFE model can be orders of magnitude more
accurate than its QFE counterpart.

with BeamDyn (LSFE) and Dymore (QFE).  LSFE model refinement was accomplished
by increasing polynomial order and QFE model refinement was accomplished by
increasing the number of elements.  }
