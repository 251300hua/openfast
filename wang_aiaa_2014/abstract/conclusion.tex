This paper presents a displacement-based implementation of geometrically
exact beam theory for three-dimensional nonlinear elastic deformation. The
Legendre spectral finite elements are adopted for spatial discretizion of
the beam. Numerical examples were presented that demonstrate the capability
of BeamDyn, a LSFE beam solver for wind turbine analysis developed by NREL. A benchmark static problem for nonlinear beam was studied first. The agreement between the results calculated by BeamDyn and analytical solution are excellent. Moreover, a convergence study has been conducted where the convergence rate of Legendre spectral elements are compared with the conventional $2^{nd}$ order elements. Exponential convergence rates were observed as expected for this type of element. A composite cantilever beam were studied both statically and dynamically. The static results are verified against those obtained by Dymore. The elastic coupling effects were shown in these two cases. It concludes that BeamDyn is a powerful tool for composite beam analysis that can be used as a module in the FAST modularization framework.
