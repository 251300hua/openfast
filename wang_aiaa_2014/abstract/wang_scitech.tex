\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a numerical implementation and examination of new wind
turbine blade finite element model based on Geometrically Exact Beam Theory
(GEBT) and a high-order spectral finite element method.  The
displacement-based GEBT is presented, which includes the coupling effects
that exist in composite structures and geometric nonlinearity.   Legendre
spectral finite elements (LSFEs) are high-rder finite elements with nodes
located at the Gauss-Legendre-Lobatto points.  LSFEs can be an order of
magnitude more efficient that low-order finite elements for a given accuracy
level.  Interpolation of the three-dimensional rotation, a major technical
barrier in large-deformation simulation, is discussed in the context of
LSFEs.  It is shown, by numerical example, that the high-order LSFEs, where
weak forms are evaluated with nodal quadrature, do not suffer from a
drawback that exists in low-order finite elements where the
tangent-stiffness matrix is calculated at the Gauss points.  Finally, the
new LSFE code is implemented in the new FAST Modularization Framework for
dynamic simulation of highly flexible composite-material wind turbine
blades.  The framework allows for fully interactive simulations of turbine
blades in operating conditions.  Numerical examples showing validation and
LSFE performance will be provided in the final paper.

\section{Introduction} 

Wind power is becoming one of the most important renewable energy sources in
the United States as demonstrated by the fact that the electricity produced
from wind amounted to 3.56\% of all generated electrical energy for the 12
months until March 2013\cite{WindWiki}. In recent years, the size of wind
turbines has been increasing immensely to lower the cost, which also leads
to highly flexible turbine blades. This huge electro-mechanical system poses
a significant challenge for engineering design and analysis. Although
possible with modern super computers, direct three-dimensional (3D)
structural analysis is so computationally expensive that engineers are
always seeking for efficient high-fidelity simplified models.

Beam models are widely used to represent and analyze engineering structures
that have one of its dimensions much larger than the other two. Many
engineering components can be idealized as beams: bridges in civil
engineering, joists and lever arms in heavy-machine industries, and
helicopter rotor blades. The blades, tower, and shaft in a wind turbine
system can be considered as beams. In the weight-critical applications of
beam structures, like high-aspect-ratio wings in aerospace and wind energy,
composite materials are attractive due to their superior weight-to-strength
and weight-to stiffness ratios.  However, analysis of structures made of
composite materials is more difficult than their isotropic counterparts due
to the coupling effects. The Geometrically Exact Beam Theory (GEBT), which
was first proposed by Reissner in 1973 \cite{Ressiner1973}, is a method that
has proven powerful for analysis of highly flexible composite beams in the
helicopter engineering community. During the past several decades, much
effort has been invested in this area. Simo\cite{Simo1985} and Simo and
Vu-Quoc\cite{Simo1986} extended Reissner's work to deal with
three-dimensional (3D) dynamic problems. Jeleni\'c and
Crisfield\cite{Crisfield1999} implemented this theory using the finite
element method where a new approach for interpolating the rotation field was
proposed that preserves the geometric exactness. Betsch and
Steinmann\cite{Betsch2002} circumvented the interpolation of rotation by
introducing a re-parameterization of the weak form corresponding to the
equations of motion of GEBT. It is noted that Ibrahimbegovi\'c and his
colleagues implemented this theory for static\cite{Ibrahim1995} and
dynamic\cite{Ibrahim1998} analysis. In contrast to the displacement-based
implementations, the geometric exact beam theory has also been formulated by
mixed finite elements where both the primary and dual field are
independently interpolated\cite{CookFEM}. In the mixed formulation, all of
the necessary ingredients, including Hamilton's principle and kinematic
equations, are combined in a single variational formulation statement;
Lagrange multipliers, motion variables, generalized strains, forces
and moments, linear and angular momenta, and displacement and rotation
variables are considered as independent quantities. Yu et al.\cite{YuGEBT,
Wang:GEBT2013} presented the implementation of GEBT in a mixed formulation;
various rotation parameters were investigated and the code was validated
against analytical and numerical solutions. The readers are referred to a
textbook by Hodges\cite{HodgesBeamBook}, where comprehensive derivations
and discussions on nonlinear composite beam theories can be found.

Legendre spectral finite elements\cite{Patera:1984,Ronquist:1987} are
$p$-type finite elements whose shape functions are Lagrangian interpolants
with node locations at the Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre points. It combines the
accuracy of global spectral methods with geometric flexibility of {\it
h}-type FEs. The spectral FEs have seen extensive, highly successful use in
the simulation of fluid dynamics\cite{Ronquist:1987, Patera:1984,
Deville:2002}, two-dimensional elastic wave propagation in solid media in
geophysics \cite{Komatitsch:1998}, elastodynamics \cite{Sridhar:2006}, and
acoustic wave propagation \cite{Sprague:2004}. However, it has seen limited
application to dynamic analysis of
beam\cite{Ben-Tal-etal:1995,Ben-Tal-etal:1996,Kudela-etal:2007a,Sprague-Geers:2008}
and plate
elements\cite{Zrahia-Bar-Yoseph:1995,Kudela-etal:2007b,Sprague-Brito:2012}. 

In this paper, we present a displacement-based implementation of
geometrically exact beam theory using Legendre spectral finite elements
(LSFEs).  This work builds on a previous effort which showed the
implementation of three-dimensional rotation parameters\cite{Wang:GEBT2013}
and a demonstration example of two-dimensional nonlinear spectral beam
elements\cite{Wang:SFE2013}. The theoretical foundation, the geometrically
exact beam theory, is introduced first. Then the interpolation of the 3D
rotation field by LSFEs is discussed along with a simple numerical example.
Finally, validation examples are provided to show the accuracy and
efficiency of the present model for realistic wind turbine blades. The code
implemented in this work is in accordance to FAST Modularization Framework
\cite{Jonkman:2013},  which allows simulation of a whole turbine under
realistic operating conditions.

\section{Geometrically Exact Beam Theory}

For completeness, this section reviews the geometric exact beam theory and
linearization process of the governing equations. The content of this
section can be found in many other papers and textbooks.
Figure~\ref{Kinematics} shows a beam in its initial undeformed and deformed
states. A reference frame $\mathbf{b}_i$ is introduced along the beam axis
for the undeformed state; a frame $\mathbf{B}_i$ is introduced along each
point of the deformed beam axis. Curvilinear coordinate $x_1$ defines the
intrinsic parameterization of the reference line.
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=5.0in]{\directory Kinematics.eps}
\caption{Schematic of beam deformation} \label{Kinematics}
\end{figure}
In this paper, we use matrix notation to denote vectorial or vectorial-like
quantities. For example, we use a underline to denote a vector
$\underline{u}$, a bar to denote unit vector $\bar{n}$, and double underline
to denote a tensor $\underline{\underline{\Delta}}$. Note that sometimes the
underlines only denote the dimension of the corresponding matrix. The
governing equations of motion for geometric exact beam theory can be written
as\cite{Bauchau:2010}
\begin{align}
	\label{GovernGEBT-1}
	\dot{\underline{h}} - \underline{F}^\prime &= \underline{f} \\
	\label{GovernGEBT-2}
	\dot{\underline{g}} + \dot{\tilde{u}} \underline{h} - \underline{M}^\prime - (\tilde{x}_0^\prime + \tilde{u}^\prime) \underline{F} &= \underline{m}
\end{align}
where $\vec{h}$ and $\vec{g}$ are the linear and angular momenta resolved in
the inertial coordinate system, respectively; $\vec{F}$ and $\vec{M}$ are
the beam's sectional forces and moments, respectively; $\vec{u}$ is the 1D
displacement of the reference line; $\vec{x}_0$ is the position vector of a
point along the beam's reference line; $\vec{f}$ and $\vec{m}$ are the
distributed force and moment applied to the beam structure.  Notation
$(\bullet)^\prime$ indicates a derivative with respect to the beam axis
$x_1$ and $\dot{(\bullet)}$ indicates a derivative with respect to time. The
tilde operator $(\skew{\bullet})$ defines a second-order, skew-symmetric
tensor corresponding to the given vector. In the literature, it is also
termed as "cross-product matrix". For example,
\[
	\skew{n} = 
	     		\begin{bmatrix}
			0 & -n_3 & n_2 \\
			n_3 & 0 & -n_1 \\
			-n_2 & n_1 & 0\\
			\end{bmatrix}	
\]
The constitutive equations relate the velocities to the momenta and the one-dimensional strain measures to the sectional resultants as
\begin{align}
	\label{ConstitutiveMass}
	\begin{Bmatrix}
	\underline{h} \\
	\underline{g}
	\end{Bmatrix}
	= \underline{\underline{\mathcal{M}}} \begin{Bmatrix}
	\dot{\underline{u}} \\
	\underline{\omega}
	\end{Bmatrix} \\
	\label{ConstitutiveStiff}
	\begin{Bmatrix}
	\underline{F} \\
	\underline{M}
	\end{Bmatrix}
	= \underline{\underline{\mathcal{C}}} \begin{Bmatrix}
	\underline{\epsilon} \\
	\underline{\kappa}
	\end{Bmatrix}
\end{align}
where $\underline{\underline{\mathcal{M}}}$ and
$\underline{\underline{\mathcal{C}}}$ are the $6 \times 6$ sectional mass
and stiffness matrices,respectively, note that they are not really tensors;
$\underline{\epsilon}$ and $\underline{\kappa}$ are the 1D strains and
curvatures, respectively. $\underline{\omega}$ is the angular velocity
vector that is defined by the rotation tensor $\underline{\underline{R}}$ as
$\underline{\omega} = \mathrm{axial}(\dot{\underline{\underline{R}}}~\underline{\underline{R}})$.

For a displacement-based finite element implementation, there are six
degree-of-freedoms(DoFs) at each node: 3 displacement components and 3
rotation components. Here we use $\vec{q}$ to denote the elemental
displacement array as $\underline{q}=\left[
\underline{u}^T~~\underline{p}^T\right]$ where $\vec{u}$ is the 1D
displacement and $\vec{p}$ is the rotation parameter vector. The
acceleration array can thus be defined as $\underline{a}=\left[
\ddot{\underline{u}}^T~~ \dot{\underline{\omega}}^T \right]$. For nonlinear
finite element analysis, the discretized and incremental forms of
displacement, velocity, and acceleration array are written as
\begin{align}
	\label{Discretized}
	\underline{q} (x_1) &= \underline{\underline{N}} ~\hat{\underline{q}}~~~~\Delta \underline{q}^T = \left[ \Delta \underline{u}^T~~\Delta \underline{p}^T \right] \\
	\underline{v}(x_1) &= \underline{\underline{N}}~\hat{\underline{v}}~~~~\Delta \underline{\dot{v}}^T = \left[\Delta \underline{\dot{u}}^T~~\Delta \underline{\omega}^T \right] \\
%	\label{Incremental}
	\underline{a}(x_1) &= \underline{\underline{N}}~ \hat{\underline{a}}~~~~\Delta \underline{a}^T = \left[ \Delta \ddot{\underline{u}}^T~~\Delta \dot{\underline{\omega}}^T \right]	
\end{align}
where $\tens{N}$ is the shape function matrix and $(\hat{\bullet})$ denotes
a column matrix of nodal values.  The governing equations for beams are
highly nonlinear so that a linearization process is needed. According to
Bauchau\cite{Bauchau:2010}, the linearized governing equations in
Eq.~\eqref{GovernGEBT-1} and \eqref{GovernGEBT-2} are in the form of
\begin{equation}
	\label{LinearizedEqn}
	\hat{\underline{\underline{M}}} \Delta \hat{\underline{a}} +\hat{\underline{\underline{G}}} \Delta \hat{\underline{v}}+ \hat{\underline{\underline{K}}} \Delta \hat{\underline{q}} = \hat{\underline{F}}^{ext} - \hat{\underline{F}}
\end{equation} 
where the $\hat{\tens{M}}$, $\hat{\tens{G}}$, and $\hat{\tens{K}}$ are the
elemental mass, gyroscopic, and stiffness matrices, respectively;
$\hat{\vec{F}}$ and $\hat{\vec{F}}^{ext}$ are the elemental forces and
externally applied loads, respectively. They are defined as follows
\begin{align}
	\label{hatM} 
	\hat{\tens{M}}&= \int_0^l \underline{\underline{N}}^T \mathcal{\underline{\underline{M}}} ~\underline{\underline{N}} dx_1 \\
	\label{hatG}
	\hat{\tens{G}} &= \int_0^l \tens{N}^T \tens{\mathcal{G}}^I~\tens{N} dx_1\\ 
	\label{hatK}
	\hat{\tens{K}}&=\int_0^l \left[ \tens{N}^T (\tens{\mathcal{K}}^I + \mathcal{\tens{Q}})~ \tens{N} + \tens{N}^T \mathcal{\tens{P}}~ \tens{N}^\prime + \tens{N}^{\prime T} \mathcal{\tens{C}}~ \tens{N}^\prime + \tens{N}^{\prime T} \mathcal{\tens{O}}~ \tens{N} \right] d x_1 \\	
	\label{hatF}
	\hat{\vec{F}} &= \int_0^l (\tens{N}^T \vec{\mathcal{F}}^I + \tens{N}^T \mathcal{\vec{F}}^D + \tens{N}^{\prime T} \mathcal{\vec{F}}^C)dx_1 \\
	\label{hatFext}
	\hat{\vec{F}}^{ext}& = \int_0^l \tens{N}^T \mathcal{\vec{F}}^{ext} dx_1 
\end{align}
The new matrix notations in Eq.~\eqref{hatM} to \eqref{hatFext} are briefly
introduced here. $\mathcal{\tens{M}}$ is the sectional mass matrix resolved
in inertial system; $\mathcal{\vec{F}}^C$ and $\mathcal{\vec{F}}^D$ are
elastic forces obtained from Eq.~\eqref{GovernGEBT-1} and
\eqref{GovernGEBT-2} as
\begin{align}
	\label{FC}
	\mathcal{\vec{F}}^C &= \begin{Bmatrix}
         \vec{F} \\
	\vec{M}
	\end{Bmatrix} = \tens{\mathcal{C}} \begin{Bmatrix}
	\vec{\epsilon} \\
	\vec{\kappa}
	\end{Bmatrix} \\
	\label{FD}
	\mathcal{\vec{F}}^D & = \begin{bmatrix}
	\underline{\underline{0}} & \underline{\underline{0}}\\
	(\tilde{x}_0^\prime+\tilde{u}^\prime)^T & \underline{\underline{0}}
	\end{bmatrix}
	\mathcal{\vec{F}}^C \equiv \tens{\Upsilon}~ \mathcal{\vec{F}}^C
\end{align}
where $\underline{\underline{0}}$ denotes a $3 \times 3$ null matrix. The $\tens{\mathcal{G}}^I$, $\tens{\mathcal{K}}^I$,  $\mathcal{\tens{O}}$, $\mathcal{\tens{P}}$, $\mathcal{\tens{Q}}$, and $\vec{\mathcal{F}}^I$ in Eq.~\eqref{hatG}, Eq.~\eqref{hatK}, and Eq.~\eqref{hatF} are defined as
\begin{align}
        \label{mathcalG}
        \tens{\mathcal{G}}^I &= \begin{bmatrix}
        \tens{0} & (\tilde{\omega} m \vec{\eta})^T+\tilde{\omega} m \tilde{\eta}^T  \\
        \tens{0} & \tilde{\omega} \tens{\varrho}-\widetilde{\tens{\varrho} \vec{\omega}}
        \end{bmatrix} \\
        \label{mathcalK}
        \tens{\mathcal{K}}^I &= \begin{bmatrix}
        \tens{0} & \dot{\tilde{\omega}}m\tilde{\eta}^T + \tilde{\omega} \tilde{\omega}m\tilde{\eta}^T  \\
        \tens{0} & \ddot{\tilde{u}}m\tilde{\eta} + \tens{\varrho} \dot{\tilde{\omega}}-\widetilde{\tens{\varrho} \vec{\dot{\omega}}}+\tilde{\omega} \tens{\varrho} \tilde{\omega} - \tilde{\omega}  \widetilde{\tens{\varrho} \vec{\omega}}
        \end{bmatrix}\\
	\label{mathcalO}
	\mathcal{\tens{O}} &= \begin{bmatrix}
	\tens{0} & \tens{C}_{11} \tilde{E_1} - \tilde{F} \\
	\tens{0}& \tens{C}_{21} \tilde{E_1} - \tilde{M}
	\end{bmatrix} \\
	\label{mathcalP}
	\mathcal{\tens{P}} &= \begin{bmatrix}
	\tens{0} & \tens{0} \\
	\tilde{F} +  (\tens{C}_{11} \tilde{E_1})^T & (\tens{C}_{21} \tilde{E_1})^T
	\end{bmatrix}  \\
	\label{mathcalQ}
	\mathcal{\tens{Q}} &= \tens{\Upsilon}~ \mathcal{\tens{O}} \\
	\label{mathcalF}
	\vec{\mathcal{F}}^I &= \begin{Bmatrix}
	m \ddot{\vec{u}} + (\dot{\tilde{\omega}} + \tilde{\omega} \tilde{\omega})m \vec{\eta} \\
	m \tilde{\eta} \ddot{\vec{u}} +\tens{\varrho}\dot{\vec{\omega}}+\tilde{\omega}\tens{\varrho}\vec{\omega}
	\end{Bmatrix}
\end{align}
The following notations were introduced to simply the writing of the above expressions
\begin{align}
    \label{E1}
    \vec{E}_1 &= \vec{x}_0^\prime + \vec{u}^\prime \\
    \label{PartC}
    \tens{\mathcal{C}} &= \begin{bmatrix}
    \tens{C}_{11} & \tens{C}_{12} \\
    \tens{C}_{21} & \tens{C}_{22}
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
 
The derivation and linearization of governing equations of geometrically exact beam theory can be found in Bauchau\cite{Bauchau:2010}.

\section{Interpolation of Rotation Field by Spectral Finite Element}
The displacement fields in a element can be interpolated as
\begin{align}
    \label{InterpolateDisp}
    \vec{u}(s) &= h^k(s) \vec{\hat{u}}^k \\
    \label{InterpolateDispp}
    \vec{u}^\prime(s) &= h^{k\prime}(s) \vec{\hat{u}}^k
\end{align}
where $\vec{u}$ is the displacement field, $h^k(s), k=1,2,...n$ are the
shape functions from first to the $n^{th}$ node; $\vec{\hat{u}}$ is the
nodal values of the displacement field. However, as discussed in
Bauchau\cite{Bauchau:2010}, the three-dimensional rotation field cannot be
simply interpolated as the displacement field in the form of
\begin{align}
    \label{InterpolateRot}
    \vec{c}(s) &= h^k(s) \vec{\hat{c}}^k \\
    \label{InterpolateRotp}
    \vec{c}^\prime(s) &= h^{k \prime}(s) \vec{\hat{c}}^k 
\end{align}    
where $\vec{c}$ is the rotation field in a element and $\vec{\hat{c}}^k$ is
the nodal value at the $k^{th}$ node, for three reasons: 1) rotations do not
form a linear space so that they have to be composed instead of added; 2)
rescaling operation is needed to eliminate the singularity existing in the
vectorial rotation parameters; 3) it is lack of objectivity, which is
defined by Crisfield and Jeleni\'c\cite{Crisfield1999} refers
to the invariance of strain measures computed through interpolation to the
addition of a rigid body motion. Therefore, we adopt a more robust
interpolation approach proposed by Crisfield and Jeleni\'c
\cite{Crisfield1999} to deal with the finite rotations.
\begin{description}
    \item[Step 1:] Compute the nodal relative rotations, $\vec{\hat{r}}^k$ by removing the rigid body rotation, $\vec{\hat{c}}^1$, from the finite rotation at each node, $\vec{\hat{r}}^k = \vec{\hat{c}}^{1-} \oplus \vec{\hat{c}}^k$.
    \item[Step 2:] Interpolate the relative rotation field: $\vec{r}(s) = h^k(s) \vec{\hat{r}}^k$ and $\vec{r}^\prime(s) = h^{k \prime}(s) \vec{\hat{r}}^k$. Find the curvature field $\vec{\kappa}(s) = \tens{R}(\vec{\hat{c}}^1) \tens{H}(\vec{r}) \vec{r}^\prime$.
    \item[Step 3:] Restore the rigid body rotation removed in Step 1: $\vec{c}(s) = \vec{\hat{c}}^1 \oplus \vec{r}(s)$.
\end{description} 
where $H$ is the tangent tensor that relates the curvature vector $k$ and rotation vector $p$ as
\begin{equation}
    \label{Tensor}
    \vec{k} = \tens{H}~ \vec{p}^\prime
\end{equation}
In the LSFE approach, shape functions (e.g., those composing $\tens{N}$) are
$n^{th}$-order Lagrangian interpolants, where nodes are located at the $n+1$
GLL-quadrature points in the $[-1,1]$ element natural-coordinate domain.
%Need more work here: a figure shows some LS elements and a short discussion of its advantages.

\section{Numerical Examples}

\subsection{Example 1: Static bending of a cantilever beam}

The first example is a benchmark problem for geometrically nonlinear
analysis of beams \cite{Simo1985,Xiao2012}. We calculate the static
deflection of a cantilever beam that is subjected at its free end to
a constant moment $M$.  The length of the beam $L$ is $10\,in$ and the cross-sectional stiffness 
matrix is given below:
\begin{equation}
    \label{StifE1}
    C = 10^3 \times \begin{bmatrix}
	1770 & 0    & 0    & 0    & 0    & 0   \\
	     & 1770 & 0    & 0    & 0    & 0   \\
	     &      & 1770 & 0    & 0    & 0   \\
	     &      &      & 8.16 & 0    & 0   \\
	     &      &      &      & 86.9 & 0   \\
	     &      &      &      &      & 215
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation} 
The load is given by the following equation:
\begin{equation}
    \label{E1Load}
    M_2 = \lambda \bar{M}_2
\end{equation}
where $\bar{M}_2 = \lambda \pi \frac{EI_2}{L}$. The parameter $\lambda$ will vary between $0$ and $2$. In 
this case, the beam is discretized with two $5^{th}$ order elements.
