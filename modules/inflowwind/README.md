# InflowWind Module

## Overview
InflowWind is a module for processing wind-inflow data. It has been coupled
into the OpenFAST multi-physics engineering tool to enable aero-elastic
simulation of horizontal-axis wind turbines. InflowWind can also be driven
as a standalone code to process wind-inflow data uncoupled from OpenFAST.

## Manual
InflowWind documentation is available on the
[NWTC Software Portal](https://nwtc.nrel.gov/InflowWind/).

## Contact
Researchers at NREL's National Wind Technology Center and Envision Energy
are generally responsible for the maintainance of this module. Inquiries
should be directed to [Andrew Platt](mailto:andrew.platt@nrel.gov)
and [Bonnie Jonkman](mailto:bonnie.jonkman@envision-energy.com).
