# AeroDyn 14 Module

**DEPRECATED**

## Overview
AeroDyn 14 is an aerodynamics software library (module) for use by designers of
horizontal-axis wind turbines. It is written to be interfaced with a dynamics
analysis software package for aero-elastic analysis of wind turbine models.
This version of AeroDyn works only with the modularization framework used in
OpenFAST.

## Manual
AeroDyn 14 documentation is available on the
[NWTC Software Portal](https://nwtc.nrel.gov/AeroDyn14/).

## Contact
AeroDyn 14 will be replaced with DBEMT and FAST.Farm as discussed in 
[issue #93](https://github.com/OpenFAST/openfast/issues/93).
