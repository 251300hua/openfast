# AeroDyn Module

## Overview
AeroDyn is a time-domain wind and MHK turbine aerodynamics module that can be
coupled into the OpenFAST multi-physics engineering tool to enable aero-elastic
simulation of horizontal-axis wind turbines. AeroDyn can also be driven as a
standalone code to compute wind turbine aerodynamic response uncoupled from
OpenFAST.

## Manual
AeroDyn documentation is available on the OpenFAST
[ReadTheDocs](https://openfast.readthedocs.io/en/master/source/user/aerodyn/index.html) site.

## Contact
Researchers at NREL's National Wind Technology Center are generally
responsible for the maintainance of this module. Inquiries should be directed
to [Jason Jonkman](mailto:Jason.Jonkman@nrel.gov).
